The Rules are to not open the .py files that include the solutions,
unless you have a solution figured out or you can not solve it.
Do not worry because it is very difficult and beginners can not
usually solve such problems, once you solve enough problems you will
start to notice patters so don't worry, everyone started from where
you are currently! :D

Exercise 1. Write a program that will (theoretically) build a
pyramid for you and give you statistics. Use the new input
technique you learned to get how many blocks you have for the
pyramid, every floor the pyramid requires 1 more block to build
so make a Blocks variable that takes input, required variable so
you can track how much is needed for the next floor and check if
you can build it, create a loop that will build it floor by floor
tracking how much has been built. At the end display how many
floors have been built, how many blocks are left, how many blocks
are required for the next floor.
OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
Floors built:  76
Blocks left:  74
Required for next floor:  77

Exercise 2. Write a program that will take a string input as the
variable "word", use the capitalize function at the end to norm it.
if you don't know what it does google it, If the input is equal 
to fizz make the output "Boom!", if the input is Buzz, ask
"Are you a bee?", if the input is "FizzBuzz" ask "What did you say?"
Example Output:
(input) FizzBuzz
What did you say?
(input) Buzz
Are you a bee?
